# Avacado-model
Model creation for Avacado price prediction

# Data
the dataset consists of 12 independent features and 1 dependent feature (Average price of avacado)

# Libraries used
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. sklearn

# Objective
1. Importing the dataset
2. Cleaning data.
3. performing EDA on the dataset.
4. Feature Engineering (if required)
5. Spliting the data.
6. Building the model (to predict Average avacado prices).
7. Evaluating the model

# Plots Used
1. Box plot
2. scatter plot
3. heatmap
4. Barplot
5. lmplot

# Inference Drawn
Created a model with polynomial features, got **RMSE** of **0.21**
